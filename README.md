# k8s_data
This repo contains scripts to gather various bits of data from Kubernetes along with some datasets under a creative commons license.

The datasets can be found in the [datasets](datasets) directory.

There are some obsolete scripts that I haven't updated in ages, but owners_details.py and get_more_owners.py are the up to date ones used to generate the datasets.
